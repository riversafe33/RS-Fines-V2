# rs_fines V2

1 - Item to create the fine

2 - Point by coordinates on the map where the player can pay the fine

3 - Blip and NPC creation within the same script

4 - Command to open a NUI to collect the money from the paid fine

5 - The same command is used to check which fines are paid or unpaid

6 - Everything is controlled by job and grade

7 - The option to attach a photo of the fined/detained player to the fine .

8 - Only certain ranks, besides collecting the money, can delete pending fines in case that player leaves the server.

9 - When you open the NUI, the NPC performs the animation as if they were writing in a book to make it more immersive.

10 - Very low resource usage in menu, maximum 0.01 ms

# For images, I recommend using https://postimages.org/ since Discord links expire.

# If you use rs_police V2, you don’t need to install this script as it is already integrated.
