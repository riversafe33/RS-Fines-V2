I create and share digital tools with passion and purpose.

There’s absolutely no pressure to donate, but if my work has been helpful to you, any contribution is sincerely appreciated.

Your support goes directly toward upgrading my PC and developing more free scripts for everyone.

Thank you for your support! ❤️

# rs_fines V2

1 - The option to attach a photo of the fined/detained player to the fine has been added.

2 - A feature has been added so that only certain ranks, besides collecting the money, can delete pending fines in case that player leaves the server.

3 - The notebook animation has been added to make it more immersive.

# For images, I recommend using https://postimages.org/ since Discord links expire.

# If you use rs_police V2, you don’t need to install this script as it is already integrated.
